```

## Optimization Insights

### Low Acceptance Rate
```
Causes & Solutions:

Poor context:
→ Improve .cursorrules
→ Better indexing setup

Wrong model:
→ Switch to more appropriate model
→ Adjust per-task settings

Lack of training:
→ Conduct workshops
→ Share best practices
```

### Underutilization
```
Signs:
- Low daily active users
- Only basic features used
- High cost per completion

Solutions:
- Training sessions
- Share success stories
- Optimize onboarding
- Gamify adoption
```

### High Costs
```
Investigation:
- Which models are expensive?
- Who are top users?
- What's the ROI?

Optimization:
- Default to cheaper models
- Set usage guidelines
- Implement budgets
- Track productivity gains
```

## Privacy & Compliance
