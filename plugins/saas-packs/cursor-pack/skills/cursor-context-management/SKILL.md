# Cursor Context Management

## Understanding Context

### What is Context?
```
Context = Information sent to AI with your prompt
- Selected code
- Open files
- @-mentioned files
- Conversation history
- .cursorrules
- Codebase index references
```

### Context Window Limits
```
Model context limits (tokens):
- GPT-3.5 Turbo: ~16K tokens
- GPT-4: ~8K tokens (32K extended)
- GPT-4 Turbo: ~128K tokens
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet: ~200K tokens
- Claude 3 Opus: ~200K tokens

Rule of thumb: 1 token ≈ 4 characters
```

## Context Sources

### Automatic Context
```
Cursor automatically includes:
1. Selected code (highest priority)
2. Current file content
3. Recently edited code
4. Import/dependency information
5. .cursorrules content
```

### Manual Context (@-mentions)
```
@filename.ts - Specific file
@folder/ - Folder contents
@codebase - Search indexed code
@docs - Documentation
@web - Web search results
@git - Git history
@terminal - Terminal output
```

## Context Optimization Strategies

### Prioritize Relevant Code
```
Most effective:
1. Select exactly the code you're asking about
2. @-mention directly related files
3. Reference patterns to follow

Less effective:
- Including entire files when only function needed
- @-mentioning unrelated files
- Large conversation history
```

### Minimize Context Waste
```
Do:
- Select specific functions, not entire files
- Use @file only for relevant files
- Start new chat when topic changes
- Be concise in prompts

Don't:
- @-mention "just in case"
- Keep long conversation threads
- Include commented-out code
- Add unnecessary explanations
```

### Context-Efficient Prompts
```
Inefficient:
"I have this code and it's not working and I need help
understanding what's wrong with it and how to fix it
because it throws an error when I run it"

Efficient:
"Fix TypeError: Cannot read 'map' of undefined
@api/users.ts line 45"
```

## Managing Large Codebases

### Selective Indexing
```yaml
# .cursorignore - reduce indexed context
node_modules/
dist/
build/
*.log
*.lock
test/fixtures/
docs/
```

### Strategic @codebase Queries
```
Specific:
"@codebase where is handleUserLogin defined?"

Too broad:
"@codebase show me all the code"
```

### Using Summaries
```
For large files, ask for summary first:
"Summarize the main exports from @lib/utils.ts"

Then dive into specifics:
"Explain the dateFormatter function in detail"
```

## Conversation Context

### When to Start New Chat
```
Start new chat when:
- Switching to unrelated topic
- Context feels polluted
- AI seems confused
- Responses are slow/truncated
- Starting fresh task
```

### Preserving Important Context
```
If switching topics but need context:
1. Copy important code/decisions
2. Start new chat
3. Paste relevant context
4. Continue with fresh window
```

### Multi-Turn Optimization
```
Good flow:
Turn 1: "Create user authentication"
Turn 2: "Add password reset to auth"
Turn 3: "Add rate limiting to auth"

Bad flow:
Turn 1: "Create user authentication"
Turn 2: "How do I sort arrays in Python?"
Turn 3: "Back to auth - add reset"
(Context confused)
```

## Context Indicators

### Recognizing Context Issues

```
Signs of context overflow:
- Truncated responses
- AI "forgets" earlier discussion
- Slower responses
- Less accurate suggestions
- AI asks for information you provided

Solutions:
- Start new chat
- Reduce @-mentions
- Select less code
- Use larger context model
```

### Monitoring Context Usage
```
Watch for:
- Response quality degradation
- Increased latency
- Incomplete code generation
- References to wrong files
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Layered Context
```
Layer 1: .cursorrules (always present)
Layer 2: @-mentions (specific files)
Layer 3: Selection (immediate focus)
Layer 4: Prompt (your question)

Optimize each layer:
- .cursorrules: Essential patterns only
- @-mentions: Only truly needed files
- Selection: Exact code in question
- Prompt: Clear, concise question
```

### Context Priming
```
Start chat with context summary:
"Working on auth module. Using JWT, refresh tokens,
httpOnly cookies. Following patterns in @lib/auth.ts.
Need to add password reset."

Then ask specific questions:
"Create the reset token generation function"
```

### Reference vs Include
```
Reference (efficient):
"Follow the pattern in UserService"

Include (uses context):
"@services/UserService.ts create similar for Products"

Use references when AI already has indexed context
```

## Best Practices

### Chat Session Management
```
1. One topic per chat session
2. Clear context between major changes
3. Summarize decisions before long gaps
4. Export important decisions to docs
```

### @-mention Strategy
```
Essential: Files you're directly modifying
Helpful: Files with patterns to follow
Wasteful: Entire folders "for context"

Start minimal, add if AI needs more
```

### Code Selection
```
Select precisely:
- The function with the issue
- The type definition needed
- The specific error location

Not:
- Entire files
- Multiple unrelated functions
- Large code blocks "just in case"
```
