│   └── Member
└── Billing Admin
```

## Member Management

- Billing adjusts automatically
```

  "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",

  // Disable conflicting features
  "editor.suggest.showInlineDetails": false
}
```

## Team Workflows

### Code Review with Cursor
```
Team workflow:
1. Developer creates PR
2. Reviewer opens in Cursor
3. Uses @git diff for AI review
4. Comments with AI suggestions
5. Developer addresses feedback

AI-assisted review:
"@git diff main..feature/auth
Review this PR for:
- Security issues
- Performance concerns
- Code style violations
- Missing tests"
```

### Pair Programming
```
With Cursor, less need for real-time pairing:

Async collaboration:
1. Developer writes initial code
2. Uses Composer for scaffolding
3. Commits with clear messages
4. Reviewer uses AI to understand
5. AI-assisted feedback

When to still pair:
- Complex architecture decisions
- Knowledge transfer
- Onboarding new members
```

## Team Analytics

### Usage Dashboard
```
Admin Dashboard > Analytics

Metrics available:
- Total completions used
- Chat requests per user
- Model usage breakdown
- Active users per day
- Feature adoption rates
```

### Monitoring Usage
```
Track team efficiency:
- Completions accepted rate
- Time saved estimates
- Most used features
- Common error patterns

Adjust based on data:
- Identify training needs
- Optimize model selection
- Improve .cursorrules
```

## Cost Management

### Billing Overview
```
Admin Dashboard > Billing

View:
- Current plan details
- User count and cost
- Usage against limits
- Billing history
- Upcoming charges
```

### Optimizing Costs
```
Strategies:
1. Right-size team seats
   - Remove inactive users
   - Use viewer roles where appropriate

2. Optimize model usage
   - Use GPT-3.5 for simple tasks
   - Reserve GPT-4 for complex work

3. Training
   - Better prompts = fewer retries
   - Proper .cursorrules = better results
```

## Support Resources

```

## Security Considerations

### Team Security
```
[ ] Enable SSO (Enterprise)
[ ] Enforce 2FA
[ ] Regular access audits
[ ] Offboarding process
[ ] API key rotation
[ ] Privacy mode policies
```

### Data Handling
```
Understand data flow:
- Code sent to AI for processing
- Not stored long-term by Cursor
- Privacy mode for sensitive code
- Audit trail available
```
