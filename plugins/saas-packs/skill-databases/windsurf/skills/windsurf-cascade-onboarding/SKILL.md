## Configuration Steps

1. **Initialize Windsurf Rules**
   - Create `.windsurfrules` with project conventions
   - Define code style and framework preferences
   - Set up language-specific instructions

2. **Configure Cascade Context**
   - Add project architecture documentation
   - Define key patterns and conventions
   - Include dependency documentation

3. **Set Up Team Defaults**
   - Configure shared snippets
   - Establish prompt templates
   - Document best practices

## Success Criteria

- Cascade responds within 2 seconds to prompts
- Context maintained across 50+ file edits
- Team productivity increases 40% in first week
