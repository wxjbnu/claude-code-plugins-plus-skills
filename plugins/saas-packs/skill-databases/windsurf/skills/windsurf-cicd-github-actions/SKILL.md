## Workflow Patterns

### Standard CI
- Checkout and cache setup
- Dependency installation
- Linting and type checking
- Test execution with coverage
- Build verification

### Deployment
- Environment-based triggers
- Approval gates
- Blue-green deployment
- Health checks

## Configuration Steps

1. **Analyze Project Requirements**
   - Identify build steps
   - Map test commands
   - Document deploy targets

2. **Generate Workflows**
   - Use Cascade for initial generation
   - Customize for project needs
   - Add environment variables

3. **Test and Iterate**
   - Run workflows locally (act)
   - Debug failures with Cascade
   - Optimize for speed

## Success Criteria

- Workflows pass validation
- Successful execution on first commit
- Pipeline setup in hours vs days
