## 📦 Package Manager (CLI)

**Discover, install, and manage plugins from your terminal.** The CLI reads from this repo's published catalog—no manual cloning required.

### Install

```bash
pnpm add -g @intentsolutionsio/ccpi
```

Or with npm/yarn:
```bash
npm install -g @intentsolutionsio/ccpi
yarn global add @intentsolutionsio/ccpi
```

### Usage

```bash
# Search plugins by keyword
ccpi search devops

# List all available plugins
ccpi list

# List installed plugins
ccpi list --installed

# Install a plugin
ccpi install ansible-playbook-creator

# Install multiple plugins at once
ccpi install devops-automation-pack security-pack api-development-pack

# Update all installed plugins
ccpi update

# Show plugin details
ccpi info project-health-auditor

# Validate plugin structure (for developers)
ccpi validate ./my-plugin
```

### How It Works

- **This repo is the source of truth** — All plugins live in `plugins/` and catalog in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.extended.json`
- **Website publishes versioned catalog** — On merge to `main`, the catalog JSON is deployed to claudecodeplugins.io
- **CLI consumes catalog with caching** — Fetches latest catalog on first use, caches locally for speed

### Update Model

- **Catalog updates:** Happen automatically when PRs merge to `main`
- **CLI releases:** Only when CLI code changes (version bumps in `packages/cli/`)
- **Plugin updates:** Run `ccpi update` to pull latest versions

## 🎓 Understanding Agent Skills

**What are Agent Skills?** They're instruction manuals that teach Claude Code **when** and **how** to use your installed plugins automatically.

### How It Works: The 4-Step Flow

```
1. DISCOVERY (Marketplace)
   └─ You browse claudecodeplugins.io
   └─ Find "ansible-playbook-creator"
   └─ Install: /plugin install ansible-playbook-creator@claude-code-plugins-plus

2. INSTALLATION (Files Copied)
   └─ Plugin files copied to your machine
   └─ Including skills/skill-adapter/SKILL.md ← The instruction manual!

3. STARTUP (Claude Learns)
   └─ Claude Code reads SKILL.md frontmatter from ALL installed plugins
   └─ Loads trigger phrases: "ansible playbook", "automate deployment"
   └─ Now Claude knows this plugin exists and when to use it

4. USAGE (Automatic Activation)
   └─ You: "Create an Ansible playbook for Apache"
   └─ Claude: Sees "ansible playbook" trigger → reads full SKILL.md
   └─ Claude: Activates plugin with correct workflow automatically!
```

### Real Example: Before vs After

**WITHOUT Agent Skills:**
```
You: "Create ansible playbook"
Claude: "I have ansible-playbook-creator installed somewhere...
         Let me manually search and figure out how to use it..."
Result: ❌ Plugin sits unused, you have to name it explicitly
```

**WITH Agent Skills:**
```
You: "Create ansible playbook"
Claude: *Recognizes trigger phrase instantly*
        *Reads SKILL.md for workflow*
        "I'll use ansible-playbook-creator for this!"
        *Automatically applies best practices*
Result: ✅ Instant activation, correct usage, zero thinking
```

### What's in a SKILL.md?

Each plugin gets ONE skill file teaching Claude:

```yaml
---
name: Creating Ansible Playbooks
description: |
  Automates Ansible playbook creation. Use when you need to automate
  server configurations or deployments. Trigger with "ansible playbook"
  or "create playbook for [task]".
---

## How It Works
1. Receives user request with infrastructure details
2. Generates production-ready Ansible playbook
3. Includes best practices and security configurations

## When to Use This Skill
- Automate server configuration tasks
- Deploy applications consistently
- Create repeatable infrastructure setups

## Examples
User: "Create ansible playbook to install Apache on Ubuntu"
Skill activates → Generates playbook → Ready to deploy
```

### Key Points

- ✅ **Not creating new plugins** - Adding instruction manuals to existing ones
- ✅ **Automatic activation** - Claude recognizes trigger phrases
- ✅ **Best practices built-in** - Each skill teaches optimal workflows
- ✅ **One skill per plugin** - Comprehensive instruction manual
- ✅ **Only for installed plugins** - Not for discovering new ones

**Status:** 739 skills deployed! 500 standalone skills across 20 categories + 239 embedded in plugins. All validated against 2025 schema.

---

### Skills Powerkit - First Agent Skills Plugin
**NEW:** The first plugin using Anthropic's Agent Skills feature (launched Oct 16, 2025). Say "create a plugin" or "validate this plugin" and Claude automatically uses these model-invoked capabilities:
- 🛠️ Plugin Creator - Auto-scaffolds plugins
- ✅ Plugin Validator - Auto-validates structure
- 📦 Marketplace Manager - Auto-manages catalog
- 🔍 Plugin Auditor - Auto-audits security
- 🔢 Version Bumper - Auto-handles versions

```bash
/plugin install skills-powerkit@claude-code-plugins-plus
```

### Skill Enhancers - Automation for Claude's Skills
**NEW CATEGORY:** Plugins that extend Claude's built-in Skills (web_search, web_fetch) with automation. Claude searches → Plugin acts.

Example: `web-to-github-issue` - Research → GitHub tickets

[Explore Skill Enhancers →](plugins/skill-enhancers/)

---

## Understanding Plugin Types

This marketplace contains **two types of plugins** that work differently:

### 1. AI Instruction Plugins (98% of marketplace)
- **What they are**: Markdown instructions that guide Claude's behavior
- **How they work**: Tell Claude HOW to perform tasks using its built-in capabilities
- **Examples**: DevOps pack, Security pack, API development tools
- **Count**: 249 plugins
- **No external code execution** - work entirely through Claude's interpretation

### 2. MCP Server Plugins (2% of marketplace)
- **What they are**: TypeScript/JavaScript applications
- **How they work**: Run as separate Node.js processes that Claude can communicate with
- **Examples**: project-health-auditor, conversational-api-debugger, domain-memory-agent
- **Count**: 7 plugins (21 MCP tools total)
- **Actual compiled code** - 13-26KB of executable JavaScript per plugin

#### Tool Routing for Token Efficiency

MCP servers load tool schemas into context. Manage active servers to optimize token usage:

```bash
/mcp                              # See active MCP servers
/mcp disable design-to-code       # Disable unused server
/mcp enable project-health-auditor # Enable when needed
/context                          # Check context usage
```

**[Full Guide: ZCF Integration & Tool Routing →](docs/zcf-integration.md)**

---

### 🧠 Agent Skills - A Feature, Not a Type

**739 Agent Skills across the marketplace** - automatic capabilities that Claude activates based on conversation context (500 standalone + 239 embedded in plugins).

- **What they are**: SKILL.md files that teach Claude when and how to use the plugin
- **How they work**: Claude reads trigger phrases and activates skills automatically
- **Example**: Say "create a plugin" and Claude uses the Skills Powerkit automatically
- **Invocation**: Automatic - no `/command` needed
- **Launched**: October 16, 2025 by Anthropic

**Skills vs Commands:** Commands require explicit `/command` trigger. Skills activate automatically based on what you're asking for.

**Note:** Plugins can bundle Skills, Commands, Agents, and MCP servers together. Agent Skills are a feature that enhances any plugin type.

## Important Notes

### Not on GitHub Marketplace

**Claude Code plugins do NOT use GitHub Marketplace.** They operate in a completely separate ecosystem using JSON-based marketplace catalogs hosted in Git repositories. This repository IS a Claude Code plugin marketplace.

### No Built-in Monetization

**There is currently no monetization mechanism** for Claude Code plugins. All plugins in the ecosystem are free and open-source. See [Monetization Alternatives](docs/monetization-alternatives.md) for external revenue strategies.

### Beta Status

Claude Code plugins are in **public beta** (October 2025). Features and best practices may evolve. This marketplace will stay updated with the latest changes.

## Documentation Filing System

This repository uses a structured documentation filing system for all internal project documentation. All documentation files are stored in the **`000-docs/` directory** using a standardized naming convention.

### File Naming Format

```
NNN-CC-ABCD-short-description.ext
```

- **NNN** = Zero-padded sequence number (001-999)
- **CC** = Two-letter category code (PP, AT, DR, RA, etc.)
- **ABCD** = Four-letter document type (PROD, GUID, REPT, etc.)
- **short-description** = 1-4 words, kebab-case

### Examples

```
048-RA-INDX-audit-index.md                   # Audit index report
061-DR-REFF-vertex-ai-gemini-tiers.md       # Reference documentation
086-PP-PLAN-release-v1-2-0.md               # Release plan
```

**Full specification:** See the Document Filing System v3.0 in prompts-intent-solutions master-systems folder
