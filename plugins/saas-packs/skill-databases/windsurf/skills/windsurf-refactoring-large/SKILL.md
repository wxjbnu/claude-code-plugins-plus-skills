## Refactoring Features

### Planning
- Impact analysis
- Dependency mapping
- Risk assessment
- Phase definition

### Execution
- Atomic changes
- Progress tracking
- Checkpoint creation
- Validation at each step

## Configuration Steps

1. **Analyze Scope**
   - Map affected files
   - Identify dependencies
   - Assess risks

2. **Create Plan**
   - Define phases
   - Set checkpoints
   - Plan rollback

3. **Execute with Cascade**
   - Apply changes incrementally
   - Validate at checkpoints
   - Track progress

4. **Verify Completion**
   - Run all tests
   - Compare performance
   - Update documentation

## Success Criteria

- All tests passing
- Zero runtime regressions
- Completed in days vs weeks
