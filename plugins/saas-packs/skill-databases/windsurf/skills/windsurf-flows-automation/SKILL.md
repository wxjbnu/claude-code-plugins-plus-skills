## Flow Types

### Creation Flows
- Component generation
- Module scaffolding
- Test file creation
- Documentation generation

### Transformation Flows
- Code refactoring patterns
- Migration scripts
- Format conversions
- Batch updates

## Configuration Steps

1. **Identify Repetitive Tasks**
   - Audit daily workflows
   - Measure time spent
   - Document steps manually

2. **Create Flow Definitions**
   - Define step sequence
   - Add variable placeholders
   - Configure error handling

3. **Test and Deploy**
   - Run in sandbox mode
   - Verify outputs
   - Enable for team

## Success Criteria

- Flows execute reliably
- Rollback capability working
- 10+ hours saved per developer monthly
