# Cursor Production Readiness Checklist

## Initial Setup

### Authentication & Licensing
```
[ ] Signed into Cursor account
[ ] Subscription tier confirmed (Free/Pro/Business)
[ ] API keys configured (if using own)
[ ] Team seats assigned (if Business)
[ ] SSO configured (if Enterprise)
```

### Core Configuration
```
[ ] Default AI model selected
[ ] Completion model configured
[ ] Chat model configured
[ ] Composer model configured
[ ] Privacy mode set appropriately
```

## Project Configuration

### .cursorrules Setup
```
[ ] .cursorrules file created
[ ] Coding standards defined
[ ] Framework-specific rules added
[ ] Team conventions documented
[ ] Examples included for complex patterns
```

### Sample .cursorrules
```yaml
# .cursorrules
project: my-app
language: typescript
framework: nextjs

rules:
  - Use TypeScript strict mode
  - Prefer functional components
  - Use Tailwind for styling
  - Write tests for all business logic
  - Use async/await over callbacks
  - Handle all error cases explicitly

naming:
  components: PascalCase
  functions: camelCase
  constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
  files: kebab-case

imports:
  order:
    - react
    - next
    - third-party
    - @/components
    - @/lib
    - relative

testing:
  framework: vitest
  coverage: 80%
```

### Indexing Configuration
```
[ ] .cursorignore configured
[ ] Large directories excluded
[ ] Build outputs excluded
[ ] Indexing completed successfully
[ ] @codebase queries working
```

## Performance Optimization

### Editor Performance
```
[ ] Unused extensions disabled
[ ] File watcher exclusions set
[ ] Max open editors limited
[ ] Search exclusions configured

Settings:
{
  "files.watcherExclude": {
    "**/node_modules/**": true,
